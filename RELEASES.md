# Release Policy

This repository publishes from two lanes while the native channel remains
Beta. This document is the source of truth for what each lane produces, which
release to download, and how the lanes converge.

## The two lanes

| Lane | Tag | Trigger | Marked as | Assets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Engine (Python package) | `vX.Y.Z` | Explicit `Release and PyPI Publish` dispatch from green protected `main` | Regular release ("Latest") | Wheel, sdist, PyPI publish attestations, **and a mirrored copy of the matching `desktop-vX.Y.Z` installer set** |
| Native installers | `desktop-vX.Y.Z` | `desktop-v*` tag push (automated, see below) | Draft, then published **prerelease** | Beta DMG (macOS arm64/x86_64), MSI + NSIS (Windows x86_64), DEB + AppImage (Linux x86_64), per-platform metadata JSON, a website-readable release manifest, and one `SHA256SUMS` manifest with GitHub artifact attestations |

The engine lane stays non-prerelease so GitHub's "Latest" pointer always names
the canonical engine release. The native lane stays prerelease because its
installer surface is Beta. The native release workflow now requires Developer
ID plus notarization on macOS, Authenticode on Windows, and GitHub OIDC
attestation over the exact Linux DEB and AppImage bytes; see
[docs/BETA_NATIVE_INSTALLERS.md](docs/BETA_NATIVE_INSTALLERS.md)
for the verification scope and signing states.

## Which release should I download?

- **Python package / CLI**: install from PyPI (`pip install openadapt-desktop`)
  or take the wheel from the newest `vX.Y.Z` release.
- **Native installers (Beta)**: either the newest `vX.Y.Z` release (the one
  `/releases/latest` resolves to) or, equivalently, the newest published
  `desktop-vX.Y.Z` prerelease whose notes do not carry a "Superseded" notice.
  The bytes are identical. Verify with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` and
  `gh attestation verify`.

### The "Latest" installer path

GitHub's `/releases/latest` excludes prereleases by definition, so it always
resolves to an engine release. That link is the one cited in launch material, so
it must not dead-end.

Two mechanisms keep it working, both driven from `native-release.yml`:

1. **`mirror-installers-to-engine-release`** copies the exact attested asset set
   (six installers, four per-platform metadata JSONs, the CycloneDX SBOM, and
   `SHA256SUMS`) from `desktop-vX.Y.Z` onto `vX.Y.Z`, re-verifying every byte
   against the attested manifest before upload. `/releases/latest` therefore
   carries a working installer, not just a link.
2. **`point-engine-release`** prepends a marker-delimited pointer block at the
   top of the engine release notes:

```
<!-- openadapt-installer-pointer:start -->
...
<!-- openadapt-installer-pointer:end -->
```

Both jobs run on `release: published` for a non-draft `desktop-v*` prerelease,
not on the tag push, for the same reason the supersession notice does:
`publish-draft` creates a **draft**, whose tag page 404s publicly, and neither a
pointer nor a mirror may advertise a URL nobody can open. The pointer block is
rewritten in place, so republishing is idempotent and pointers never accumulate.
If the matching engine release is missing, both jobs fail loudly rather than
leaving "Latest" without an installer.

#### Why mirroring does not promote the Beta channel

The earlier policy here was "linked, not mirrored", on the reasoning that
putting ~757 MB of Beta binaries on the release GitHub labels "Latest" would
overstate their maturity. A notes-only link was not
enough: `/releases/latest` still showed a visitor nothing but a wheel and an
sdist, and that link is what launch material points at. The maturity concern is
addressed directly instead of by withholding the artifact:

- `desktop-vX.Y.Z` **stays a prerelease**. Flipping it to non-prerelease would
  make the native lane GitHub's "Latest" outright, and that remains forbidden.
- Every filename encodes its trust state — `…-developer-id-notarized.dmg`,
  `…-authenticode.msi`, or `…-github-attested.AppImage`.
- The pointer block leads with the required platform trust contracts and gives
  the `sha256sum -c` and `gh attestation verify` commands.
- The mirror job re-verifies every downloaded byte against the attested
  `SHA256SUMS` before upload, so an engine release can never carry an installer
  that was not attested on the native tag.
- The engine release gets **assets only**. It never receives the
  `<!-- installer-release -->` marker, so the machine-readable selection rule
  below is unchanged and download-page consumers keep resolving `desktop-v*`.

`desktop-vX.Y.Z` therefore remains the canonical installer release — build
provenance, attestations, and supersession notices are bound to it — and
`vX.Y.Z` carries a byte-identical convenience copy.

## Freshness automation

The native lane previously lagged the engine lane because `desktop-v*` tags
were pushed by hand. Three workflows now keep it fresh:

1. **Release and PyPI Publish** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): a maintainer
   explicitly dispatches one semantic release after the intended release train
   has landed. It refuses to publish until the exact protected-main commit has
   successful `Test` and `Build artifacts` push workflows. The recovery operation
   can rebuild and publish a pre-existing, main-contained ref after checking that
   ref's exact CI; ordinary merges never publish packages.
2. **Native Installer Freshness** (`.github/workflows/native-freshness.yml`):
   when that engine release is published (or on manual `workflow_dispatch` with
   a current engine version), it first verifies that the matching engine tag is
   an ancestor of `main` and that the application sources have not advanced.
   It then synchronizes the native version sources (`package.json`,
   `package-lock.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`,
   `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`) to the engine version, commits to `main`, and
   pushes the matching `desktop-vX.Y.Z` tag. It never builds anything itself
   and refuses a historical backfill that would label newer application code
   with an older version.
3. **Native Installer Release** (`.github/workflows/native-release.yml`):
   unchanged build semantics — the tag push triggers the fail-closed signing
   preflight, the platform build matrix, install/launch/uninstall smoke tests,
   final-byte checksums, attestation, and a **draft** prerelease that a
   maintainer reviews and publishes. The build matrix runs only on `desktop-v*`
   tags, not on ordinary pushes.

As a result every engine release `vX.Y.Z` gets a matching native prerelease
`desktop-vX.Y.Z` built from the same version.

## Supersession

After a native prerelease is published, older published `desktop-v*` prereleases
are edited to carry a prominent "Superseded by `desktop-vX.Y.Z` — do not use"
notice at the top of their notes (machine marker:
`<!-- openadapt-superseded-by: desktop-vX.Y.Z -->`). The previous published
installer remains valid while its replacement is a draft, so the notice always
points at a publicly available replacement. CI never deletes releases or
assets; superseded assets are retained for provenance and any deletion is a
human decision.

## Machine-readable selection rule (download pages)

Consumers that list releases via the GitHub API (for example the
openadapt.ai download page) should select installers from release metadata
alone:

- A native installer release is identified by its tag prefix `desktop-v` and by
  the `<!-- installer-release -->` marker at the top of its notes; its assets
  include the platform installers.
- Recommended rule: offer downloads from the newest non-draft `desktop-v*`
  prerelease whose body contains `<!-- installer-release -->` and does **not**
  contain `<!-- openadapt-superseded-by:`.
- Plain `v*` engine releases also carry a mirrored copy of the matching
  installer set, but they deliberately do **not** carry the
  `<!-- installer-release -->` marker. Selection logic must keep matching on
  the marker plus the `desktop-v` prefix, so the mirror is invisible to it. The
  mirror exists for humans who land on `/releases/latest`.
- `openadapt-desktop-release-manifest.json` is the website-readable index. It
  lists each artifact name, platform, architecture, signing state, and SHA-256,
  plus the checked CycloneDX SBOM. The release workflow recomputes the named
  hashes and validates the complete file set against `SHA256SUMS` before it
  creates the GitHub attestation. A consumer must still verify the checksums
  and attestation; `github-attested` is an exact-byte Linux trust label and is
  not a native-signing claim.

## Convergence plan

The next native release cannot publish until Apple Developer ID plus
notarization and Windows Authenticode are configured and the Linux exact-byte
attestations verify. After the first complete trusted release proves the full
channel, the repository can simplify the two upload targets:

1. The native build workflow attaches its attested installer assets to the
   canonical `vX.Y.Z` engine release *instead of* also creating a separate
   `desktop-v*` prerelease. (Step 1 is already half-done: `vX.Y.Z` carries the
   assets today via `mirror-installers-to-engine-release`. What remains is
   retiring the second upload target, not adding the first.)
2. The `desktop-v*` prerelease lane retires; existing `desktop-v*` prereleases
   remain as historical, superseded records.
3. The `<!-- installer-release -->` marker moves to `vX.Y.Z` with the assets,
   and the pointer/mirror jobs retire with the lane.

Until then, the freshness automation above keeps the two lanes at the same
version.
