// and there was no scroll depth at which reading was required. Everything that
// calibrates the answer was present on the page and none of it was on the path
// to the action.
//
// `#gate` is the last element in the document, so the answers become available
// only once the operator has reached the end of what the engine had to say.
// When the engine had little to say the gate is already on screen and the
// answers appear at once: this is meant to be fast when the answer is obvious
// and structurally slower when it is not, in proportion to the evidence, rather
// than a fixed tax on every decision.
