"""Credential lifetime: report the deadline, and renew it without an outage.

A Cloud ingest credential lives 90 days. Two things follow, and this module
owns both:

* **Warn early.** ``GET /api/needs-attention/count`` -- the one authenticated
  call this machine already makes on a timer -- returns how long the credential
  it just used has left. :func:`credential_status` reads it, and
  :func:`expiry_warning` turns it into a line the operator sees.
* **Renew without downtime.** ``POST /api/ingest-tokens/rotate`` mints the
  replacement FIRST and only then shortens the outgoing credential to a bounded
  overlap. So :func:`rotate_credential` can store the replacement knowing the
  credential currently in the keychain keeps working meanwhile: if the write
  fails, or the process dies between the two, the machine is still connected.

Nothing here decides that a credential is still valid. Expiry is enforced
server-side on every request; this is a warning and a renewal, not a check.
