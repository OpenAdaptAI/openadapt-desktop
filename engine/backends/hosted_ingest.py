The former adapter accepted any ZIP file and sent it to ``POST /api/ingest``.
It could not prove that Flow had inventoried, sanitized, reviewed, and frozen
the exact bytes. The adapter remains importable for protocol compatibility,
but it fails closed. Use :func:`engine.hosted.push`, which delegates to Flow's
approved sanitized-derivative contract.
