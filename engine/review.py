"""Upload review state machine and egress gating.

Every recording has a review status that persists in the index database.
This status gates ALL outbound data paths -- not just storage uploads, but
also VLM API calls, annotation pipelines, federated learning, sharing,
and any future feature that sends data off-machine.

State machine (from design doc Section 5):

``DISMISSED`` records a local choice only. It never permits raw-data egress.

All outbound data paths MUST call check_egress_allowed() before sending
any data off-machine. This is the single enforcement point.
